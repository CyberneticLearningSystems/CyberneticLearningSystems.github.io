		      <div class="entry">
		        <p>Finding a new name for a research group which doesn’t exist at every other Artificial Intelligence institute is difficult - impossible even. We knew our focus lies in the design of AI solutions for complex systems, particularly using Reinforcement Learning methods. We knew that we wanted to keep our options open, given the broad interests and skills within our team. We also knew we wanted to differentiate ourselves from the rest, so we got a bit creative. Eventually Manuel came up with the idea to use “Cybernetics”. The rest of us were a bit puzzled at the idea, seeing as for our generation, the terminator was what we pictured under cybernetics. Little did we know that the word itself refers to a field of science which perfectly describes what we do!</p>
