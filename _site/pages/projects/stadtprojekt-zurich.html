      <p>On behalf of the Zurich Environmental and Health Protection (UZG) agency, a literature study was carried out to gather the most important scientific findings regarding the 
connections between traffic planning measures and air quality. The findings served as a scientific basis for decision-making on the remediation plans for the 
Bellerivestrasse.</p>

<em>Figure: Percentage change in emission levels with a speed reduction from 50 km/h to 30 km/h.</em></p>

<p>The City of Zurich commissioned the research group at the IDP in cooperation with the Centre for Aviation to conduct a literature study focusing on the relationship 
between traffic flow, driving speed and pollutant emissions. The focus was on the reduction of driving speed from 50 km/h to 30 km/h, the emission differences between 
the traffic modes “green wave” vs. “stop-and-go” and the reduction of lanes from four to two.</p>

<p>The findings obtained served the city of Zurich as a scientific basis for the traffic regulation measures planned for Bellerivestrasse at the time, which had the goal of 
reducing traffic congestion, lowering noise emissions, and promoting green mobility.</p>
