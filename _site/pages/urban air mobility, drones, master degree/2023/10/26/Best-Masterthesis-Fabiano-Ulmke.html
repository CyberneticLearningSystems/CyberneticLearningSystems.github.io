  <h1>Fabiano Ulmke receives Award for Best Master Thesis in 2023</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>In his master thesis Fabiano Ulmke developed a concept for economically viable operation of On-Demand Air Taxis in the greater area of the city of Zurich on behalf of the Lucerne-based aerospace company <a href="https://careers.aurora.aero/">Aurora Swiss Aerospace</a>. By 2035, Fabiano Ulmke estimates that the first air taxis carrying passengers will be operational in Switzerland. Fabiano was awarded by the Association of Business Engineers (VWI) Switzerland for the best Master thesis in Business Engineering in 2023.

<h2 id="finding-an-interesting-topic-was-a-challenge">“Finding an interesting topic was a challenge”</h2>

<p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, finding a suitable topic for his Master’s thesis was a challenge, as companies in the aerospace industry offered limited opportunities for collaboration in the form of theses and similar projects. However, thanks to Manuel Renold, who is well connected in the industry, they discovered an exciting research opportunity in collaboration with Aurora Swiss Aerospace.</p>

<p>In his thesis, Fabiano developed a concept for economically viable On-Demand Air Taxi operation in the greater area of the city of Zurich. He analyzed available demographic, economic, and mobility data to define possible take-off and landing locations for an air taxi service where individuals could request drone transport to destinations such as Zurich Airport and other pivotal locations. Fabiano deliberately selected landing sites in wealthy areas, recognizing that initial drone commuting costs would be relatively high. The strategy is to secure initial funding from affluent individuals, paving the way for broader investments as the service established its presence. Fabiano encountered considerable challenges due to the scarcity of available data for his research. Largely devoid of existing literature, he had to build his analysis from the ground up, especially considering the uniqueness of the Zurich region. His data sources were predominantly drawn from the Zurich Transportation Network (ZVV). Furthermore, the creation of requisite infrastructure was of paramount importance, as drones can’t simply land in residential areas. Instead, the project necessitated the establishment of dedicated landing sites featuring drone-compatible infrastructure, access controls, and rigorous security measures, particularly for cross-border flights.</p>

<h2 id="sustainability-is-a-key-factor-in-my-career-choices">“Sustainability is a key factor in my career choices”</h2>
<p>Looking ahead to his professional carrer, Fabiano Ulmke, currently employed by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), envisions a potential transition to the aviation sector in the future. However, his commitment to sustainability plays a pivotal role in his career choices. He believes that sustainability within the aviation industry still requires substantial development.</p>

<p>On behalf of the entire research group, we would like to congratulate Fabiano on his outstanding Master’s thesis. His dedication, hard work and remarkable contribution have truly impressed us. We are proud that Fabiano has chosen to work with our research group leader, Dr. Manuel Renold, during his Master’s degree and Master’s thesis. We wish Fabiano all the best in his future career and may he take the opportunity to bring his ideas and vision of a more sustainable aviation to the industry!</p>
