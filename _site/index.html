<meta name="description" content="Welcome to the world of AI and Intelligent Systems This is the personal blog of the research group Cybernetic Learning Systems, a part of the Center for Artifical Intelligence at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences. Dear visitor, we are glade to introduce ourselves, our projects, interests and engagements to you. Our team is dedicated and motivated to drive innovation in aviation and related industries through the application of artificial intelligence and development of intelligent systems. Feel free to contact us any time Our team applies data-driven machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to operations research, focusing on industry needs. While our projects are mainly centred around the aviation industry under the term “AI in Aviation”, our team has completed many successful projects with partners beyond aviation using a broad array of methods from simple machine learning models to more advanced methods such as deep learning models for computer vision or GANs. More recently, our group has been further expanding our list to include reinforcement learning, which is the direction we are heading with our latest research projects (see AI4REALNET and brAIght). Picture: David Augsburger Our fields of expertise range from classic statistical methods to stochastic and machine-based optimization (e.g. Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization), macro- and micro-economic analyses and the modelling and simulation of processes on the ground and in the air. In addition to the development of conventional simulation models in the field of discrete-event and agent-based simulation, we also conduct research on new methods in machine learning and artificial intelligence (GANs, Deep Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, etc.). We apply these methods to complex operational problems inside and outside the aviation industry. Our main tasks include the simulation of processes such as passenger flow dynamics or baggage fow, capacity analyses and management, delay propagation, revenue management, hub and spoke load balancing and network analyses. The methods and solutions developed provide a basis for decision-making on complex problems as part of operation management for partners within the aviation industry and their stakeholders." />
