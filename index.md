# **Welcome to the world of AI and Intelligent Systems**


This is the personal blog of the research group [**Intelligent Systems and AI in Operations**](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institute-zentren/idp/forschungsthemen/operation-in-aviation/), a part 
of the [**Institute of Data Analysis and Process Design**](https://www.zhaw.
ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/idp/) at the [**Zurich University of Applied Sciences**](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/).

> *Dear visitor,
we are glade to introduce ourselves, our projects, interests and engagements to you. Our team is dedicated and 
> motivated to drive innovation in aviation and related industries through the application of artificial intelligence 
> and development of intelligent systems.* 
> <br>
> *Feel free to contact us any time*

<br>
Our team applies data-driven machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to operations research, 
focusing on industry needs. While our projects are mainly centred around the aviation industry under the term "AI in Aviation", 
our team has completed many successful projects with partners beyond aviation using a broad array of methods from 
simple machine learning models to more advanced methods such as deep learning models for computer vision or GANs. 
More recently, our group has been further expanding our list to include reinforcement learning, which is the 
direction we are heading with our latest research projects (see [AI4REALNET](./pages/projects/ai4realnet.md) and 
[brAIght](./pages/projects/braight.md)).

Our fields of expertise range from classic statistical methods to stochastic and machine-based optimization (e.g. Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization), 
macro- and micro-economic analyses and the modelling and simulation of processes on the ground and in the air. In addition to the development of conventional 
simulation models in the field of discrete-event and agent-based simulation, we also conduct research on new methods 
in machine learning and artificial intelligence (GANs, Deep Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, etc.). We apply these methods to complex 
operational problems inside and outside the aviation industry. 

Our main tasks include the simulation of processes such as passenger flow dynamics or baggage fow, capacity analyses and management, delay propagation, 
revenue management, hub and spoke load balancing and network analyses. The methods and solutions developed provide a basis for decision-making on complex 
problems as part of operation management for partners within the aviation industry and their stakeholders.
