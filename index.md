# **Welcome you in the world of AI in Operations**


This is the personal blog of the research group [**Intelligent Systems and Operations in Operations**](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institute-zentren/idp/forschungsthemen/operation-in-aviation/) being part of the [**Institute of Data Analysis and Process Design**](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/idp/) at the [**ZHAW**](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/).


> *Dear visitor,
*We are glade to introduce ourself and our projects as well as our engagements to you. Our team is dedicated and motivated to drive the application of artifical intelligence for operations research in aviation and related industries. Feel free to contact us any time*

Our team believes in the value of applying data-driven artificial intelligence algorithms to operations research to drive value for industry. The team focuses on applying its techniques mainly to the aviation industry, but has also successfully completed projects with partners beyond aviation. Their approach from simple machine learning models to more advanced methods such as deep learning models for computer vision or GANs and also reinforcement learning. The latter is the direction we are heading with our latest research projects (e.g. see [AI4REALNET](./pages/projects/ai4realnet.md)).

Our expertise includes statistical methods, stochastic optimization (e.g. Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization), macro- and micro-economic analyses as well as machine-based optimization and the modelling and simulation of aviation processes on the ground and in the air. In addition to the development of conventional simulation models in the field of discrete-event and agent-based simulation, we also conduct research on new methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning (GANs, Deep Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, etc.). We apply these methods to complex operational problems inside and outside the aviation industry. 

Our main tasks include the simulation of processes such as passenger flow dynamics, capacity management and capacity analyses, delay propagation, revenue management, hub and spoke load balancing, network analyses and the simulation of baggage processes.

The methods and solutions developed provide a basis for decision-making on complex problems as part of operation management for partners within the aviation industry and their stakeholders.
