description: Keeping Swissport at the Front of Innovation with Human-Centered RL Solutions
---

In collaboration with the internationally present airport ground handling service provider Swissport, our team has begun
work on the development of AI and ML systems which will monitor operations, simulate future events and provide recommendations
for optimisation and disturbance mitigation. 

Aviation being as volatile as it is, Swissport's operations are subject to a multitude of external variables which 
can have substantial negative impacts, leading to delays and customer dissatisfaction. These uncontrollable events 
are equally difficult to predict for human dispatchers, making choosing an appropriate course of action equally 
challenging. The envisioned solution reduces the mental load for human dispatchers by serving as an easily 
accessible monitoring system, providing not just real-time metrics but also prognoses and trajectories for different 
time-horizons. An AI system trained through observation of human dispatchers provides action recommendations, which 
can be accepted, rejected or adjusted by the human operator, creating an online learning environment for the agent 
while simultaneously supporting human decision-making. 

Similar to the AI4REALNET project, a high degree of human control is essential to the project, with the end goal of 
fostering trust and an environment of mutual learning between AI agents and human operators.
