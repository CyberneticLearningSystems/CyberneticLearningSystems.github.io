title: Swiss Post Digital Twin for Parcel Logistic Optimization
description: Research project in collaboration with Swiss Post to optimize parcel logistic on railway and road network
---

In collaboration with Swiss Post our research group developed a digital twin for optimizing parcel logistics on their railway and road network. The optimization algorithm is based on a digital twin which was initially developed in two subsequent project thesises of master students. The digital twin based on discrete-event simulation was further developed by Dr. Manuel Renold and his team. The model is now capable of optimizing the resource allocation of freight wagons via the Swiss Posts railway fleet and trucks on the road. The combinatorial optimization algorithm solves the vehicle routing problem (VRP) using integer programming to find the global best solution of the discrete set of all feasible solutions.
