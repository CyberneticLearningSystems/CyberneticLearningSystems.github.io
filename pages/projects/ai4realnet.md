title: AI4REALNET - AI for Real-world Network operation 
description: Horizon Europe research projects including 9 partner universities
---

The European research project AI4REALNET deals with AI-based solutions for critical systems (electricity, railways and air traffic) that are traditionally operated by humans. The modelled networks are intended to complement and extend human capabilities through artificial intelligence.

AI4REALNET is a Horizon Europe funded research project with a total of nine partner universities and research technology organizations (RTOs) and six industrial partners. AI4REALNET aims to develop a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach that combines emerging AI algorithms, open-source digital environments and socio-technical design to effectively operate network infrastructures in a real-time and predictive manner. The project will test and evaluate AI in industry-relevant use cases, focusing on three critical infrastructures: power grids, railway systems and air traffic management. These infrastructures are considered vital in Europe and their disruption would have severe societal consequences.

The AI4REALNET vision promotes a harmonious coexistence of humans and AI, guaranteeing a high degree of human control over the AI-based automation. This coexistence is categorized into the following three levels: Full human control with AI support, joint AI-human learning including adaptive autonomy, and trustworthy human-certified full AI-based control. Another focus of the project is the development of hybrid decision systems, where AI and humans work together in teams and use the capabilities of AI to improve mission-critical operations. AI4REALNET aims to redesign these systems by integrating AI to achieve optimal performance.

The team at the “Intelligent Systems and Operations in Aviation” research group is heavily involved in the development of the project and is primarily concerned with fully AI-based decision systems with a focus on the railway domain, and with a strong involvement in research and development for co-learning with Deep RL (Deep Reinforcement Learning), XAI (Explainable AI) and RL for large networks. The team also contributes to the improvement of the Flatland simulation environment.
