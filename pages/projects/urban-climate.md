title: Meteoblue - High-Resolution Urban Climate 
description: 
---

In cooperation with Meteoblue, the aim of the project was to produce high-resolution temperature maps of the city of Zurich. The maps were generated using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which draws data from large-scale weather model. The training data set for the algorithms used consisted of a network of over 250 measuring stations within the city of Zurich.

The Meteoblue Urban Climate project combines state-of-the-art methods from the field of machine learning to form a novel pipeline for the generation of high-resolution (HR) urban temperature maps. The proposed method is two-fold, utilising an adapted regression forest (RF) technique to generate dense HR temperature maps using datapoints from a sparse in-situ measurement network and a series of meteorological and geospatial feature variables. The measurement network encompasses over 250 stations throughout urban Zurich, delivering temperature and humidity measurements every 10 minutes over two years. By adjusting the geospatial features, it becomes possible to evaluate the influence of urban projects (for example greening or removal of parks) on temperature.

The temperature maps generated by the RF serve as a training dataset for a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which is trained to perform super-resolution under consideration of physical processes and the cityâ€™s specific behaviour patterns. The trained GAN can then be fed with predictions from large-scale models to generate HR super-resolutions thereof.
