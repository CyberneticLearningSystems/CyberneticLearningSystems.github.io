### Janik Vollenweider - Researcher

Janik completed his BSc. in Aviation in 2020 and continued his Master in Engineering with specialisation in Aviation from 2020 to 2023. He gained professional experience in the transport industry at SBB and during his bachelor's degree through an internship at Zimex Aviation followed by part-time employment. During his master's degree, Janik started as a research assistant in Manuel's team. He mainly focused on the development of the Vertiport simulation in cooperation with Wisk and Aurora Flight Sciences. Through his knowledge of agent-based simulation, acquired during his bachelor thesis, he also assisted lecturers about passenger flow simulations at airports. He demonstrated his knowledge of airline profit in a project thesis during his master's degree and was involved in the underlying research within the group.

As the drone nerd in the group, he focused his master's thesis on developing a high-fidelity UAV simulation to validate operational flight procedures that require a permit to fly. Together with the start-up [incluas](https://incluas.ch/), he explored new ways to reduce the costs of real-flight tests required for drone operations that require a flight approval. When he's not sitting behind his desk, he's repairing and tuning his FPV drones or enjoying the freedom of pushing them through tiny caps or flying them at speeds of up to 120 km/h within half a metre of the ground....a lot of crashes included. True to the motto "Fail Fast, Fail Often!"
