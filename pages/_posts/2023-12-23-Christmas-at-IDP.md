Who doesn't love Christmas? We definitely do - which quickly becomes evident to anyone who walks past our office...

The 13th of December marked the annual ZHAW School of Engineering Christmas party. After a lovely review of the past year, the celebrations began and spirits were high. The evening was filled with interesting conversations, lots of laughs and good food. We were amongst the last to leave, perhaps a bit unwilling to let the festivities end. As the Markom (Marketing and Communication) team began to take down the decorations from the Christmas tree, Janik couldn't help but ask "What are you going to do with the tree?", to which they simply shrugged and said it would be thrown away. 

Well, we couldn't stand to see such a beautiful tree go to waste. They agreed to let us have the tree, and even lent us the decorations. And with that, our mission was clear:
1. Remove all decorations
2. Transport the Christmas tree back to our office
3. Re-decorate the tree
4. Continue the festivities

Long story short, the mission was successful, although we're sorry to report that casualities were incurred. Two Christmas ornaments did not survive the re-decoration stage.

It was a sight to behold - a Christmas tree in the middle of the office, Christmas music playing in the background and the lot of us decorating the tree together. An unconventional, yet very effective form of team building. We look back on the evening fondly, and love the funny looks and laughs we get when people walk past our office and see our beautiful tree for the first time. Julia even brought lights!

We wish everyone happy holidays, and look forward to everything that the new year will bring with it!
