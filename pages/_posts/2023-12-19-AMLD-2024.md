### Our Engagement at the Applied Machine Learning Days 2024

We are very excited to announce that not just one, but two of our applications have been accepted for the [Applied Machine Learning Days](https://2024.appliedmldays.org/) (AMLD) from March 23-26 in 2024! The AMLD is one of the largest AI/ML conferences in Europe, hosting participants from over 40 countries and providing the opportunity to learn about the latest research and insights in machine learning, network with fellow experts in the field and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Lausanne.

Starting off the conference days, Julia will lead a special workshop for students specialising and interested in Reinforcement Learning. The *RL Student Session* workshop will take place on the first day of the AMLD and aims to facilitate networking between PhD and undergraduate students, provide a stage to present current research projects and discuss the difficulties, pitfalls and potential of RL. 

Together with [Chryshanthi Tsimitri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctsimitri/) of SWISS and [Lishuai Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lishuai-li-621589a/) of Hong Kong City University, Manuel and Julia will be organising the *AI in Aviation* track on the first conference day (25th of March) from 14:00 to 17:30. This track is targeted at both academics and industry representatives interested in advancing aviation operations, optimising logistics and modernising mobility with innovative aeronautical AI applications. 

Feel free to contact us if you're interested in presenting! Otherwise we look forward to seeing you in the crowd!
