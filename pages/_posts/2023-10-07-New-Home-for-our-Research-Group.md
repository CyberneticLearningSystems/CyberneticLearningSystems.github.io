We're very excited to announce Dr. Manuel Renold has been appointed as the head of the new *Cybernetic Intelligence* Research Unit at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence. His research group, consisting of Janik Vollenweider, Julia Usher and Oliver Carmignani will join him in the move. We leave behind the Institute of Data Analysis, the Traffic and Transport Engineering Group and many long-standing friendships with heavy hearts, yet we look forward to continued collaboration.

It's time to pack the banana boxes, as of the beginning of February 2024, our research group will be moving! Building a research unit from the ground up is no simple task, yet with the support of his team, Manuel has no doubt that together, we will continue to expand our skillsets, deepen our knowledge and develop some really cool AI with a positive impact on the world! 

If you're interested in knowing more about how and why we chose *Cybernetic Intelligence*, we have a separate blog post explaining the lore behind our chosen name.
