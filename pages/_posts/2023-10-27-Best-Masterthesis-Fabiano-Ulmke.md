In his master thesis Fabiano Ulmke developed a concept for economically viable operation of On-Demand Air Taxis in the greater area of the city of Zurich on behalf of the Lucerne aerospace company [Aurora Swiss Aerospace](https://careers.aurora.aero/). By 2035, Fabiano Ulmke estimates that the first air taxis carrying passengers will be operational in Switzerland. With his thesis Fabiano was awarded by the Association of Business Engineers (VWI) Switzerland for the best Master thesis in Business Engineering in 2023.

## Selecting an interesting was a challenge

Selecting a suitable topic for his master's thesis was challenging after the COVID-19 pandemic as companies in the aviation industry only offered limited opportunities to collaborate in the form of theses and similar projects. However, thanks to Manuel Renold who is well-connected in the industry both together uncovered a captivating research opportunity in collaboration with Aurora Swiss Aerospace.

By 2035, Fabiano Ulmke estimates that the first air taxis, drones carrying passengers, will be operational in Switzerland. He analyzed available demographic, economic, and mobility data to define possible take-off and landing locations for an air taxi service where individuals could request drone transport to destinations such as Zurich Airport and other pivotal locations. Ulmke deliberately selected landing sites in wealthy areas, recognizing that initial drone commuting costs would be relatively high. The strategy was to secure initial funding from affluent individuals, paving the way for broader investments as the service established its presence. Fabiano encountered considerable challenges due to the scarcity of available data for his research. Largely devoid of existing literature, he had to build his analysis from the ground up, especially considering the uniqueness of the Zurich region. His data sources were predominantly drawn from the Zurich Transportation Network (ZVV). Furthermore, the creation of requisite infrastructure was of paramount importance, as drones couldn't simply land in residential areas. Instead, the project necessitated the establishment of dedicated landing sites featuring drone-compatible infrastructure, access controls, and rigorous security measures, particularly for cross-border flights.

## Sustainability is a key factor in his career choices
Looking ahead to his professional journey, Fabiano Ulmke, currently employed by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), envisions a potential transition to the aviation sector. However, his commitment to sustainability plays a pivotal role in his career choices. He believes that sustainability within the aviation industry still requires substantial development. 

On behalf of the entire research group, we would like to congratulate Fabiano on his outstanding Master's thesis. His dedication, hard work and remarkable contribution have truly impressed us. We are proud that Fabiano has chosen to work with our research group leader, Dr. Manuel Renold, during his Master's degree and Master's thesis. We wish Fabiano all the best for his future career and may he take the opportunity to bring his ideas and vision of a more sustainable aviation towards the industry!
