The first of February marked our first day at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence as the **Cybernetic Learning Systems** research group. We were warmly welcomed by the members of the institute and subsequently decked out in merch. New mugs, a hoodie, stickers, lanyard - you name it, we have it.  

Our badges not working for the better part of our first week was not enough to deter us from returning to the office day after day. Now that we no longer require porters to let us in, we can confidently say we've settled in. Home is where the badge works. Thanks to everyone at CAI for being so welcoming (and rescuing us from working in the corridor) - we're very excited to be a part of this institute and help push the frontiers of AI.
