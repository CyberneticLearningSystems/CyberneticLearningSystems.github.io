# Supervised Theses BSc/MSc/PhD

The ongoing supervision of theses at all levels is an important component alongside research and teaching activities. The close support of students, if they wish so, but also the opportunity for them to choose their own project and pursue their research questions in collaboration with or without industrial partners, is part of the group's success story. The following selected theses were supervised by members of the research group.
