description: Our publications in scientific journals and presentations and at conferences
---

We are proud to be regularly publishing in scientific journals and holding speeches at conferences around the world. 
Our research activities lead us to actively participate in hosting, co-hosting or chairing well-known conferences. 
For example, Manuel Renold recently chaired at the [International conference for Research in Air Transportation 
(ICRAT)](https://www.icrat.org/ ) and at the [Air Transport Research Society World Conference (ATRS)](https://www.atrsworld.org/). He is 
also editor of thejournal [AI in Aviation](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/19880/ai-in-aviation), which is part of the well-known journal Fontiers. Our team are
also actively involved in the organisation of the [Applied Machine Learning Days](https://appliedmldays.org/) at the 
EPFL in Lausanne, which attracts (facts about AMLD)
