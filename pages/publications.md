We are proud to actively participate in publications for scientific journals or presentations at conferences world wide. Our research activities lead us to become actively part in hosting and co-hosting or being chairman and chairwoman at well-known conferences. As an example Manuel Renold was recent chairman at ICRAT and ATRS. Furthermore, he is editor for AI in Aviation being part of the well-knonw Fontiers journal. He and his this is also actively involved in co-hosting the Applied Machine Learning Days. 
Member of the research group hosted or co-hosted the conference [AI in Aviation](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/19880/ai-in-aviation)

We are proud to be actively involved in publishing in scientific journals or holding speech at conferences around the world. Our research activities lead us to actively participate in hosting, co-hosting or chairing well-known conferences. For example, Manuel Renold recently chaired at the [International conference for Research in Air Transportation (ICRAT)](https://www.icrat.org/ ) and at the [Air Transport Research Society World Conference (ATRS)](https://www.atrsworld.org/). He is also editor of the journal [AI in Aviation](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/19880/ai-in-aviation), which is part of the well-known journal Fontiers. He and his team are also actively involved in the organisation of the [Applied Machine Learning Days](https://appliedmldays.org/) at the EPFL in Lausanne
